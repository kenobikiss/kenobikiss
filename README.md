w2i . i get cover discomfort .

i need tone tags sometimes

i come off rude usually , but it's not my intent . sorry .

i get clingy to star wars ponies , so if i linger--that's why .

hi , my name is luke or whatever name u know me as

any prns are fine by me , i really don't care

cuddles , hide , and whispers are fine ; i just ask its from my fandoms , but that's just a preference .
‚Äç
if ur apart of the hellverse , murder drones , or hoyoverse i probably won't interact because the fandoms are usually annoying . and DNI to those stupid blunt ponies who torment other fandoms/spaces to "get high" or something .

if you're weird towards me i'll block you .
